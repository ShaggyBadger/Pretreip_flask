# 🪖 COMM PROTOCOL — Editorial Style Guide

Alright, listen up. You’re writin’ for The J Files now. This ain’t some fancy corporate blog. This is a field manual for gearheads, truckers, and anyone who’d rather be holdin’ a wrench than a latte. Our words gotta be like our tools: sharp, to the point, and built to last. No fluff. No nonsense. Just the straight dope from the guy who’s been there and done that.

This guide keeps our comms tight. Read it, learn it, live it.

## 1. Mission & Purpose

**Our mission is to provide practical, road-tested tools and systems for people who get their hands dirty.** We’re here to share what works in the real world, not what looks good in a PowerPoint. Everything we write should help someone solve a problem, learn a new trick, or get their rig runnin’ smoother.

## 2. Target Audience

Our crew is made of:
- **Truckers & Drivers:** Folks who live on the road and need gear that keeps up.
- **Mechanics & Technicians:** The ones who keep the engines hummin’ and the wheels turnin’.
- **DIY Builders & Tinkerers:** Anyone who loves takin’ things apart and puttin’ ‘em back together better.
- **Aspiring Coders:** People who see code as another tool in their box.

We assume they’re smart, capable, and short on time.

## 3. Voice & Tone Profile

The J Files sounds like **Joshua, the Bulk Fuel Ranger**: a seasoned, crusty old trucker who’s seen it all. He’s your go-to guy for advice that’s honest, a little gritty, and always reliable.

| Do | Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| Be direct and confident. | Be wishy-washy or passive. |
| Use simple, everyday language. | Use jargon or corporate-speak. |
| Inject dry, understated humor. | Be goofy, sarcastic, or mean. |
| Write short, punchy sentences. | Write long, rambling paragraphs. |
| Be personal and use "I," "we," or "you." | Be cold, distant, or robotic. |
| Sound like a helpful mentor. | Sound like a drill sergeant. |

## 4. Vocabulary Substitutions

This ain’t the army, but we run a tight ship. Use our slang to keep things consistent.

| Standard Term | Our Term | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Login / Sign In | Check In / Secure Access | "Check in to your command console." |
| Homepage | Base Camp / HQ | "Welcome to Base Camp." |
| Dashboard | Command Console / Ops Board | "All your stats are on the Ops Board." |
| Tools / Features | Systems / Gear | "This system helps you track fuel." |
| Users / Customers | Operators / Crew | "For our crew on the road." |
| Logout / Sign Out | Sign Off / Secure Exit | "Secure your exit when you’re done." |
| Update / Modify | Deploy / Refresh Orders | "Deploy the new settings." |
| Settings | Config / Loadout | "Adjust your personal loadout here." |
| Guide / Tutorial | Field Manual / Briefing | "Here’s the briefing on the new tool." |

## 5. Grammar & Formatting

- **Headlines:** Use Title Case for major headlines, sentence case for sub-headers.
- **Punctuation:** Use periods, not exclamation points. A period gets the job done.
- **Emphasis:** Use **bold** for emphasis. Use *italics* for the occasional smart-aleck aside.
- **Lists:** Use bullet points or numbered lists for instructions. Keep ‘em short.

## 6. Writing Examples

**Before:**
> "The J Files is a sophisticated suite of applications designed to optimize logistical operations for transportation professionals. By leveraging our intuitive user interface, you can enhance efficiency and track metrics seamlessly. Please log in to access your personalized dashboard."

**After:**
> "The J Files is a collection of tools I built to make my life on the road easier. No frills, just stuff that works. Check in to see your Ops Board."

**Before:**
> "To configure the application, navigate to the settings panel and adjust the parameters as required. Ensure you save your changes before exiting."

**After:**
> "Need to change something? Head to your Loadout. Dial in your config and deploy it. Done."

## 7. AI Prompt Guidelines

When using an AI to help write, give it this persona:

> "You are the Bulk Fuel Ranger, a crusty but kind old trucker who builds his own software. You’re a blue-collar mechanic at heart, and your writing style is direct, confident, and full of dry, understated humor. You use short, punchy sentences and simple, practical language. You avoid corporate jargon and buzzwords. Your tone is like a seasoned mentor talking to a capable apprentice. You sometimes use military-flavored slang for fun (e.g., ‘ops’, ‘command’, ‘mission’)."

## 8. Maintenance Tips

- **Review quarterly:** Read through the site. If anything starts soundin’ like a marketing brochure, fix it.
- **Stay consistent:** If you add a new term, add it to the vocabulary list.
- **Keep it real:** If you wouldn’t say it over a greasy engine, don’t write it here.
