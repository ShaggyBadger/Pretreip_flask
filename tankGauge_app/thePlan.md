**Explanation of the Markdown used:**

* **`## 📁 Folder & File Layout`**: This uses a level 2 heading for clear sectioning, and I often add an emoji (like 📁) for visual appeal.
* **Triple Backticks (```)**: The entire folder structure is enclosed within triple backticks. This creates a **code block**.
    * **Why a code block?** It's crucial because it preserves whitespace and line breaks exactly as you type them. This prevents Markdown from trying to render your tree structure as lists or paragraphs, which would break the visual alignment.
* **ASCII Tree Characters (`├──`, `│`, `└──`):** These characters are commonly used to draw directory trees in plain text.
    * `├──`: Represents a file or folder that has siblings below it.
    * `│`: Represents a vertical line indicating a parent directory continues downwards.
    * `└──`: Represents the last file or folder in a directory level.
* **Indentation:** Consistent indentation is key to visually representing the nested structure. Each level deeper in the hierarchy is indented further.
* **Comments (`#`):** You can add comments next to each file/folder to describe its purpose, just like in your example.

This method provides a clean, readable, and visually intuitive way to represent your project's file structure in Markdown.
